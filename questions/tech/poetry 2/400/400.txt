You won’t find it listed beside Python’s name,
But it still runs macros with logic and flame.

It’s hiding in menus where few dare to click,
With toolbars that speak like a classic relic.

It lives in the ribbon, in beige-colored tabs,
Where legacy code still politely grabs.

It’s loyal and clunky, verbose but sincere,
A language that’s older than half your career.
