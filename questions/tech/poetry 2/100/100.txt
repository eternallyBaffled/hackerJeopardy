He lived with a shotgun, two phones, and a goat,
Declared war on taxes from someone’s houseboat.

His neighbor was missing, the jungle was loud,
He tweeted in riddles and hacked from a cloud.

He once wrote the code to keep viruses back,
Then swore it was malware and staged an attack.

He filmed how to purge what once bore his name,
Then shot the whole laptop and laughed through the flame.
