The code was a whisper, unseen in the sand,
It danced through the circuits, not guided by hand.

No ransom was asked, no banner was shown,
Just rotors that whirled till their timing was blown.

It knew what to seek with surgical grace,
A virus that mapped out each nuclear place.

A phantom of state, unsigned and unknown—
The first cyberweapon the world had been shown.
