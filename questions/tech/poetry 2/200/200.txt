They wrapped it in jargon, performance and grace,
But gutted the tools we used to erase.
The scripts once so mighty were cut to the bone,
Reduced to a whisper, ignored on their own.

With static rules framed in a neat little list,
The ad scripts kept running — the blockers just missed.
Chrome wears the badge of a user’s best friend,
But this technology broke what we defend.
