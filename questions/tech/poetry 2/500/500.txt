Not built to be run, not written in bash,
But copied in zines with no digital flash.
No rootkits inside, no function to ping—
Just echoes of “curiosity’s” sting.

They feared it in courtrooms and quoted it wrong,
Confused by a file that didn’t belong.
No breach in its bytes, just ethics on scroll—
A TXT file that still punches whole.
