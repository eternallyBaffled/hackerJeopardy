The config was simple, the day was slow,
Until someone pasted a name they didn’t know.
The console replied with a confident “Yes,”
Then fetched something live from a shell-shaped address.
A kettle rebooted, the fridge went to sleep,
And suddenly Jira grew twenty-five deep.
The boss asked why Java was trending today—
So we muted the thread and walked away.
