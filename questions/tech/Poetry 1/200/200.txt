In code-laced vaults where digits slept,
A midnight tick made time inept.

Old cobol monks with coffee grim,
Whispered, “Zero's knife is at the limb.”

The bankers wept, their screens went dark,
A toaster launched at Central Park.

But clocks moved on, the world stayed lit—
The beast was real, but threw no fit.
