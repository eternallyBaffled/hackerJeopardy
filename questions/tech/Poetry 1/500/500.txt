The users were married, divorced, or confused—
All joined a system they couldn’t refuse.
The backend was silent, the frontend all tease,
Until all the data escaped on a breeze.
The taglines were flirty, the hashes were stale,
The platform was built like a paper-thin jail.
They promised “anonymity” sealed in chrome,
But everyone Googled the list from home.
